/**
 * Practice: Building functions
 *
 * - Create a basic function declaration - you’ll remember that’s where we say “function” followed by the name of the function.
 * - In the body of the function declaration, do something to an element in the DOM. For this you can use any of the techniques we’ve covered earlier - finding an element using querySelector, adding a class, whatever you like.
 * - Call the function declaration so the action takes place.
 * - Create a basic function expression - that’s when you define a variable and place an anonymous function inside
 * - Do the same as above - find an element, make a change to it, call the function, make sure it works.
 * - Finally, create an arrow function, make it do something, and call it.
